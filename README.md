## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
I learned how to use CSS custom properties to make the design more flexible and easier to maintain.
Centering a div and aligning image and text in a line inside it was a challenge. I used Flexbox to achieve this.
